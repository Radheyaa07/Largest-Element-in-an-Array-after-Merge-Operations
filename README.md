# Largest-Element-in-an-Array-after-Merge-Operations
Added solution for LeetCode 2769 - Find the Maximum Array Value
Example:
Given: [2, 2, 4, 8]

You can merge the first two 2s:

Now it becomes: [4, 4, 8]

Now you can merge the two 4s:

It becomes: [8, 8]

Now you can merge those 8s:

It becomes: [16]

âœ… So in this order, the biggest number is 16.
